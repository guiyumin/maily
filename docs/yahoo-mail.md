# Yahoo Mail Setup

Similar to Gmail, Yahoo requires an **App Password** instead of your regular account password for third-party email clients.

## What You Need

1. **Your Yahoo email address** (e.g., `you@yahoo.com`)
2. **An App Password** (16-character code generated by Yahoo)

## How to Get an App Password

1. **Enable Two-Step Verification first** (required)
   - Go to Yahoo → Profile icon → Account Info → Account Security
   - Enable "Two-step verification"

2. **Generate an App Password**
   - Same page: scroll to "Generate and manage app passwords"
   - Click "Get started"
   - Enter an app name (e.g., "Maily")
   - Yahoo generates a 16-character password

3. **Use that App Password** when logging into Maily (not your normal Yahoo password)

## Server Settings

| Setting     | Value                   |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| IMAP Server | `imap.mail.yahoo.com`   |
| IMAP Port   | `993` (SSL)             |
| SMTP Server | `smtp.mail.yahoo.com`   |
| SMTP Port   | `465` (SSL) or `587` (TLS) |

## Important Notes

- App passwords stay valid even if you change your main password
- To revoke access, delete the app password from Yahoo's security page
- Yahoo has a limit of 500 emails/day
